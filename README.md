## Semantic release, commitizen  with Github actions Guide

Semantic release is used to manage the release in your project automatically.

---

## Setup and initialization

1.  Run the following command in the _project directory_ `npx semantic-release-cli setup`
2.  You will face some questions. Let us answer them one by one.
    1.  What is your npm registry? Here you can press enter and choose default which is `(https://registry.npmjs.org/)`
    2.  For the following question, you will need an npm account.
        1.  What is your npm username?
        2.  What is your npm password?
        3.  What is your NPM two-factor authentication code? If you have setup the two auth factor you will find the code in your email.
        4.  Provide a Github Personal Access Token? you can create a token from this page at [github tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) then paste it
        5.  What CI are you using? - Github Actions
3.  Next we need to add some configuration and
    1.  Add a file named .releaserc in your root directory, we need to stop publish on npm, we need just github so attach this config to the file you've created

```plaintext
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@semantic-release/npm",
      {
        "npmPublish": false
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

              2. now we are ready to add a github actions wirk flow to mangage release automaticley

3\. create file .github/workflows/release.yml and paste this code but befor this you will need to create an [npm access token](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/ahmedtolan/tokens/) and create secret env variable in your github repo name `NPM_TOKEN`

```plaintext
name: release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - next
      - beta
      - "*.x"


jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          cache: "npm"
          node-version: 16
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

and that will create a job to automatically detect the commit and add a version number fit to it so we need a convention and standard way to write commits so,we will use commitizen extention for vs code and plugin for our node project

### commitizen installation

firstly install it globaly `npm i -g commitizen`  
then run this command `commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact`  
now you will need to add script to your pachage json, let us say `"commit" : "git-cz"`  
and finally add the helpful [extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen) to vs code

lastly, the next commit you run `npm run commit`
